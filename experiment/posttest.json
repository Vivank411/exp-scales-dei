      "question": "To construct a scale of 1.5 inches = 1 foot to show inches are long enough to measure up to 4 feet, then R.F. = ____",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.125",

        "d": "0.5"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "R.F. (Representative Fraction) = Drawing length / Actual length = 1.5 inches / 12 inches = 0.125. This fraction represents how the drawing size relates to the actual size of the object."

      "question": "In constructing a plain scale, where should the zero be placed?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the beginning of the scale",

        "d": "At the midpoint of the scale"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In plain scale construction, zero is placed at the end of the first main division so that sub-divisions extend to the left. This allows for precise measurement of fractional parts."

      "question": "In a vernier scale, what is the Least Count (LC) equal to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1 m.s.d. + 1 v.s.d.",
        "b": "1 m.s.d. - 1 v.s.d.",

        "d": "1 m.s.d. / 1 v.s.d."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Least Count (LC) = 1 main scale division - 1 vernier scale division. This difference determines the smallest measurement that can be accurately read using the vernier scale."

      "question": "How many equal parts should a line of 15 cm be divided into when constructing a diagonal scale with an R.F. of 1/1?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "10",
        "b": "12",
        "c": "15",
        "d": "20"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since R.F. = 1/1 (actual size) and the actual length = 15 cm, the line should be divided into 15 equal parts to represent 15 units accurately on the diagonal scale."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "In a vernier scale construction, if 8 equal parts on the main scale represent a total length of 2 meters, then how many divisions should be made on the vernier scale to measure with higher accuracy? (Use Formula: 1 v.s.d. = 1 m.s.d. / n)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "8",
        "b": "10",
        "c": "12",
        "d": "16"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "To achieve higher accuracy and reduce each division, the number of vernier scale divisions should typically be double the main scale parts. Here, 8 × 2 = 16 divisions provide better precision."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the forward reading vernier constructed along with the main scale?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By subtracting 1 m.s.d. from 1 v.s.d.",
        "b": "By adding 1 m.s.d. to 1 v.s.d.",
        "c": "By dividing 1 m.s.d. by 1 v.s.d.",
        "d": "By multiplying 1 m.s.d. by 1 v.s.d."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Forward (direct) vernier is constructed using the formula: 1 v.s.d. = (n+1)/n × m.s.d., which means 1 v.s.d. > 1 m.s.d., effectively adding to the main scale division."

      "question": "When constructing a diagonal scale, what does the term 'R.F. = 1/5' mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The main scale is 5 times larger than the actual size",
        "b": "The main scale is 1/5th of the actual size",
        "c": "The main scale is 1/5th the length of the diagonal scale",
        "d": "The diagonal scale is 5 times larger than the actual size"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "R.F. (Representative Fraction) = Drawing length / Actual length = 1/5 means that the scale drawing is 1/5th (or 20%) of the actual size of the object being represented."

    },
    {
      "question": "When constructing a scale, why is it important to round off the calculated length to the next higher whole number?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make the drawing more accurate",
        "b": "To ensure the scale is long enough for measurements",

        "d": "To simplify the calculations"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Rounding up to the next higher whole number ensures that the constructed scale covers the full range of required measurements without falling short, providing adequate length for all intended measurements."

        "b": "Scale length = (R.F.) × actual length = (1/2000) × 1500 cm = 0.75 cm per meter × 10 meters = 7.5 cm. The scale must be 7.5 cm long to represent 15 meters at 1:2000 scale."
