      "question": "The ratio of the linear dimensions of element of the object as represented in a drawing to the actual dimensions of the same element of the object itself is called _______.",

        "b": "Measurement",
        "c": "Scale",
        "d": "Representative fraction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Scale is the fundamental concept in engineering drawing that defines the ratio between the drawing size and the actual object size. It determines how much larger or smaller the drawing is compared to the real object."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "When the drawing is of the same size as that of the object, the scale used is _______.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vernier scale",
        "b": "Full-size scale",
        "c": "Diagonal Scale",
        "d": "Half-size scale"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "A full-size scale means the drawing is created at a 1:1 ratio, where every dimension on the drawing equals the corresponding dimension on the actual object. This is used when the object size allows for practical drawing representation."

        "c": "Drawing with graphical scale",
        "d": "Drawing with representative fraction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Enlarging scale is used when the drawing is larger than the real object, typically for small components like screws, electronic parts, or intricate mechanisms that need magnification for clear representation and dimensioning."

      "question": "Where should we mention the R.F. of the scale?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Above the scale",
        "b": "Upper right corner of the sheet",
        "c": "Below the scale",
        "d": "As a center heading"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The Representative Fraction (R.F.) is conventionally written below the scale in engineering drawings for standardization and clarity. This placement ensures easy identification and reference without interfering with the scale markings."

    {
      "question": "How is the length of a scale calculated in the construction process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Length of the scale = R.F. / Maximum Length",
        "b": "Length of the scale = R.F. × Maximum Length",
        "c": "Length of the scale = Maximum Length / R.F.",
        "d": "Length of the scale = R.F. - Maximum Length"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The scale length is calculated by multiplying the Representative Fraction (R.F.) by the maximum actual length to be measured. This ensures the constructed scale can accommodate all required measurements within the drawing space."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "Drawings of buildings are drawn using ________",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Full-size scale",
        "b": "Reducing scale",
        "c": "Scale of chords",
        "d": "Enlarging scale"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Reducing scale is used for building drawings because buildings are much larger than practical drawing sizes. Common scales like 1:100, 1:200, or 1:500 are used to fit large structures onto manageable drawing sheets."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "For drawing small instruments, the R.F. would be _______",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Equal to one",
        "b": "Less than one",
        "c": "Greater than one",
        "d": "Zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "For small instruments and components, the drawing is typically enlarged to show details clearly, making the R.F. greater than 1. Common enlarging scales include 2:1, 5:1, or 10:1 depending on the level of detail required."

        "b": "Graphical Scale",
        "c": "Representative Function",
        "d": "Scale of chords"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Engineering scale expresses the scale relationship using numerical length ratios in the format of drawing unit = actual unit (e.g., 10 mm = 5 m). This method clearly shows the proportional relationship between drawing and reality."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "R.F. stands for Representative Fraction, which is the mathematical expression of scale as a fraction: R.F. = Drawing length / Actual length. It provides a dimensionless ratio that defines the scale relationship."

      "explanations": {
        "b": "R.F. = Drawing length / Actual length. Here, Drawing length = 1/14080 miles, Actual length = 6 miles. Therefore, R.F. = (1/14080) ÷ 6 = 1/(14080 × 6) = 1/84480."
